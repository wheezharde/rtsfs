RTS From Scratch

Just a fun little project making an RTS from scratch. We'll see how far it goes. :)

The intent is to write pretty much everything, but often these will just be an interface to reused libraries.  For example, the project may use some modern C++ STL, but it'll be wrapped or typedef'd appropriately.

The project will be a mixture of C and C+ where objects are typically POD. "Modern C++" will be mostly ignored for simplicity of reading ("just because YOU know what it does doesn't mean that ALL programmers do; K.I.S.")
